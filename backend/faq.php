        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p><b>1. What is the business objective? What problem are we trying to solve? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?</b></p>
        <p>The business objective defines the purpose of the project. It clarifies what problem we aim to address and how we'll measure success using specific KPIs.  For example, are we trying to increase sales, reduce customer churn, or improve efficiency?  KPIs might include conversion rate, customer retention, or processing time.</p>

        <p><b>2. What data is available? What are the sources of data? What are the data types and formats? Is the data clean and complete?</b></p>
        <p>Understanding the available data is crucial.  We need to identify the data sources (databases, APIs, files), the types of data (numerical, categorical, text), their format (CSV, JSON, SQL), and assess its quality.  Data cleaning and preprocessing are often necessary to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.</p>

        <p><b>3. What are the relevant features? Which features are most important for predicting the target variable? Are there any features that are redundant or irrelevant?</b></p>
        <p>Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant variables that contribute to the prediction.  We need to determine which features are important for predicting the target variable and remove any redundant or irrelevant features that might negatively impact model performance.</p>

        <p><b>4. How will the model be evaluated? What metrics will be used to assess model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC)?</b></p>
        <p>Model evaluation requires defining appropriate metrics to measure how well the model performs.  The choice of metrics depends on the specific problem and the type of model.  Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).</p>

        <p><b>5. What are the potential biases in the data? How can we mitigate these biases?</b></p>
        <p>Data bias can lead to unfair or inaccurate models. It's essential to identify potential biases in the data (e.g., sampling bias, historical bias) and implement strategies to mitigate them, such as data augmentation, re-weighting, or using fairness-aware algorithms.</p>

        <p><b>6. How will the model be deployed and maintained? What is the infrastructure for deploying and monitoring the model?</b></p>
        <span>Model deployment involves integrating the trained model into a production environment.  We need to consider the infrastructure required for deployment and ongoing monitoring to ensure the model continues to perform well over time.</span>
